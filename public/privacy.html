					            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						            <p>&emsp;Discord recently started requiring bots to provide a privacy policy. As so, I have quickly written this policy.</p>
							            <h3>Policy Scope</h3>
								            <p>This policy describes how Luwu, a discord bot, collects, uses, and reatains user data </p>
									            <h3>Data collection and usage</h3>
										            <p>&emsp;We may store any sort of Snowflake IDs provided by the Discord API in order to provide entity association for features in which the
											            bot may provide. We may store any sort of user input associated with our bot's features, however, we will not knowingly store sensitive data,
												            identifying data, unnecessary data, or data which is not used in our bot's features. By interacting with our bot, you authorize us to store said
													            data. We may also store entity-associated statistical data, such as how often a user sends a message, in order to allow the functionality of
														            certain bot features. We may store configurations which may consist of previously mentioned data, in order to provide feature configurability.
															            Additionally, we may store other types of non-entity-associated statistical data, in order to improve our services. Certain bot features may
																            forward data to third-party providers, who may store data under their own privacy policies.</p></br>
																	            <h3>Data retention</h3>
																		            <p>&emsp;Luwu will attempt to automatically delete guild-related data when it goes out out of scope.
																			            In the case that this fails, users may manually request this data to be deleted, if the bot is no longer in the server.
																				            Additionally, for any server in which the bot is still in said server, users who own or maintain said server can delete data using the associated command,
																					            or by making a request in a support server we have and proving that they own or maintain the guild in question.</p>
																			            <p>&emsp;Luwu does not currently have provisions for automatically removing user data.
																				            Moderation data and guild-specific data is stored with a reference to the guild, and will be deleted with guild data.
																					            Any non-moderation user data (including non-moderation guild-user data) can be removed by visiting any support server we may have and manually 
																						            requesting this deletion under the associated user account.
																							            This privacy policy will be updated when additional provisions are added.</p>
																				            <p>&emsp;Additionally, any data from Discord, or pertaining to Discord (e.g. data using Discord's Snowflake IDs) may be deleted upon an official request from Discord.</p>
