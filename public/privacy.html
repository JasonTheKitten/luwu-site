		<h1>Privacy Policy (Updated 2021-12-1</h1>
		<h3>Policy Scope</h3>
		<p>
			This policy describes how Luwu, a bot for chatting platforms, collects, uses, and retains user data. This policy may be updated at any time, but a public
			notification must be sent whenever this policy is updated.
		</p>
		<h3>Definitions of terms</h3>
		<p>
			"User data" refers to any data that has a reference to a user. "Guild data" refers to any data that has a reference to a guild or server.
			"Guild-user data" refers to data that is both user data and guild data. "Guild owner" refers to a user within a guild or server that has elevated permissions
			to manage said guild. When the term guild owner is used in reference to a user or feature, it is assumed that the guild owner is within the same guild or server as
			the user or feature. "User input" refers to either any parameters entered into a bot command, or data used by a feature that either a guild owner or the user who created
			the data has opted into. "Entity-associated data" refers to either user-data or guild-data. "Moderation data" refers to data used for the purpose of moderating a guild or server
			(for example, whether a user has been muted using a bot command). Any time this policy mentions the terms "guild" or "server" without saying "guild or server", it is
			assumed that "guild or server" was meant.
		</p>
		<h3>Data collection and usage</h3>
		<p>
			&emsp;On a given chat platform, we may store unique identifiers in order to provide entity association for features in which the
			bot may provide. We may store any sort of user input associated with our bot's features (minus any exceptions mentioned later in this policy);
			however, we will not knowingly store sensitive data, identifying data, unnecessary data, or data which is not used in the features that our bot provides.
			By interacting with our bot, you authorize us to store said data. We may also store entity-associated statistical data, such as how often a user sends a message,
			in order to allow the functionality of certain bot features. We may store configurations which may consist of previously mentioned data, in order to provide feature configurability.
			Certain bot features may forward data to third-party providers, who may store data under their own privacy policies. We will not store message content in our database unless
			the user clearly intended to interact with the bot (for example, by running a command). We will not forward message content to other platforms unless the
			user who sent the message has opted into the feature of the bot that would forward said message content. Any data stored within our database is encrypted at rest.
		</p>
		</br>
		<h3>Data retention</h3>
		<p>
			&emsp;The bot will attempt to automatically delete guild-related data when it goes out out of scope.
			In the case that this fails, users may manually request this data to be deleted, if the bot is no longer in the server.
			Additionally, for any server in which the bot is still in said server or server, users who own or maintain said guild or server can delete data using
			the associated command, or by making a request in a support server we have and proving that they own or maintain the guild in question.
		</p>
		<p>
			&emsp;The bot does not currently have provisions for automatically removing non-guild-user data, but removal of this data may be manually requested
			(by means specified later in this policy).
			Moderation data and guild-specific data (including guild-user data) is stored with a reference to the guild, and will be deleted with guild data.
			Any non-moderation user data (including any non-moderation user data) can be removed by having the user referenced by the user data visiting any support server
			that we may have and manually requesting this deletion under the associated user account.
			(This privacy policy will be updated when additional provisions are added.)
		</p>
		<p>
			&emsp;Additionally, any data from obtained from or pertaining to a given chat platform may be deleted upon an official request from the staff team of said platform.
