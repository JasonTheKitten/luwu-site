        <title>Luwu Privacy Policy</title>
    </head>

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>&emsp;Discord recently started requiring bots to provide a privacy policy. As so, I have quickly written this policy.</p>
        <h3>Policy Scope</h3>
        <p>This policy describes how Luwu, a discord bot, collects, uses, and reatains user data </p>
        <h3>Data collection and usage</h3>
        <p>&emsp;We may store any sort of Snowflake IDs provided by the Discord API in order to provide entity association for features in which the
        bot may provide. We may store any sort of user input associated with our bot's features, however, we will not knowingly store sensitive data,
        identifying data, unnecessary data, or data which is not used in our bot's features. By interacting with our bot, you authorize us to store said
        data. We may also store entity-associated statistical data, such as how often a user sends a message, in order to allow the functionality of
        certain bot features. We may store configurations which may consist of previously mentioned data, in order to provide feature configurability.
        Additionally, we may store other types of non-entity-associated statistical data, in order to improve our services. Certain bot features may
        forward data to third-party providers, who may store data under their own privacy policies.</p></br>
        <h3>Data retention</h3>
        <p>&emsp;Luwu will attempt to automatically delete guild-related data when it goes out out of scope, however, this may fail, or when a user or
        Discord request guild data deletion for a guild in which they can verify they have control over, or any guild not in scope.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Luwu does not currently have provisions for removing user data. This privacy policy will be updated when said provisions are added.</p>
